# Haskell School of Music

## Setup

Following the instructions in [the Euterpea
site](http://www.euterpea.com/download-and-installation/):

* Install [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (v 8.4.3 as of the time of writing)
* Try to install Euterpea, but failed:

```
```

Had to edit this file `sudo vim
/Library/Frameworks/GHC.framework/Versions/8.4.3-x86_64/usr/lib/ghc-8.4.3/settings`
as recommended by [this stack overflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50386787/cabal-install-gcc-failed-in-phase-c-compiler/50419101#50419101)
as linked by [this github issue for haskell
platform](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-platform/issues/304).

The edit was simply changing this line to "NO":

```
, ("C compiler supports -no-pie","YES")
```

* Install the HSoM library, too, with `cabal install HSoM`.
* Set up MIDI: http://www.euterpea.com/euterpea/setting-up-midi/ (was as simple
  as downloading [SimpleSynth](http://notahat.com/simplesynth/).

After the above is done, and SimpleSynth is open, this should work (i.e. play a
sound):

```
