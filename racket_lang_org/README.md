# Playing around with some of the official Racket guides


## Development

DrRacket is cute, but I'm too used to Emacs for my Lisp forays, so I installed [Racket Mode](https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode) (as recommended by [the official guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Emacs.html)) and after just telling my emacs where my `racket` binary was, I was able to launch it and follow the very cute [Introduction to Racket with Pictures](https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/7.1/doc/quick/index.html). At one point I may tinker with [Geiser](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/geiser_3.html#The-REPL), but this is good enough for me for now:
